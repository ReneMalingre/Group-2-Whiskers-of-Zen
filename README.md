- Move to the favourites screen (where you can access your favourited pictures later)

### App-screen ###

- Rate each image for their cuteness & the impact on your stress level using the two sliders. The next pair of images will display once this is done.
- (optional) Favourite an image using the favourite (heart) button, and leave a comment for you to look back in the 'favourites' page later.
- Click on a photo to view the full resolution image (resolution will vary for each photo)
- Click on a breed name to learn more about that breed (will pop up as a modal).

Once you finish rating all the images, you will be taken to the ending screen with your results!

The sidebar can be used to access:
- Relaxing music
- Home screen (can also be accessed using the browser's back button)
- Favourites page

### Ending-screen ###

The ending screen will display how much images you rated, how much 'Zen' (stress reduction) you've achieved and how cute you found the images.

![Sample screenshot of the achievements tab](assets/img/app-demonstration/achievements-demo.png)

Open the achievements tab to see what achievements you unlocked (based on how many & how you rated the images). Highlighted achievements indicate that you've earned that achievement!

Based on the ratings, images of various categories (e.g. the images that you rated the 'cutest') will be loaded. You can also favourite those images using the heart button if desired.

From here, you can:
- Go back to the home screen to generate more images
- Go to the favourites page to look back on images you've favourited

### Favourites ###

Images you've favourited will be saved on this page for your enjoyment.

You can unfavourite the image(s) also.
